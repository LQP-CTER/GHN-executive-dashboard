<div align="center"><h1>GHN Executive Dashboard & AI Predictive</h1><h3>IBCS Standard · Operations Insights · Flight Risk Radar · Machine Learning</h3><p><b>Tech Stack:</b> Python | Streamlit | Machine Learning (Random Forest) | License: MIT</p></div>GHN Executive Dashboard is a comprehensive operational and human resources analytics system. Moving beyond traditional static reports, this system provides deep interactivity and data visualization strictly adhering to International Business Communication Standards (IBCS).AI Integration: Beyond Descriptive Analytics, the system leverages a Random Forest machine learning model to transition into Predictive Analytics, autonomously assessing and flagging employee flight risks before they occur.<table align="center"><tr align="center"><td align="center" valign="top"><p align="center"><i>[Screenshot: Executive Dashboard UI]</i><b>IBCS Standard Interface</b></p></td><td align="center" valign="top"><p align="center"><i>[Screenshot: AI Flight Risk Radar]</i><b>AI Predictive Model</b></p></td></tr></table>Release Notes2026-02-12 Launched version 1.0: Finalized Multi-language Dashboard capabilities and successfully integrated the Random Forest machine learning model.Key FeaturesIBCS Standard Compliance: Minimalist design with zero visual noise. Strict color coding (Grey for actuals, Red for risks, Green for positive variance) optimizes executive focus.Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to evaluate Feature Importance and predict the probability of resignation (Flight Risk) for individual employees.Internationalization (I18N): Seamless switching between English and Vietnamese with a single click, catering to diverse management teams and expatriate executives.Logistics Deep-Dive: Goes beyond standard HR metrics by mining industry-specific insights, such as Late vs. Overtime correlation, Delivery Route Characteristics (Urban vs. Suburban), and Warehouse Health Matrix.CriteriaTraditional Excel/BIGHN Executive DashboardInteractivityStatic / LimitedReal-time & Highly InteractiveAnalytical PerspectiveDescriptive (Past)Predictive (Future)Design & ColorSubjective, often clutteredProfessional IBCS StandardDeployment CostRequires Licenses (PowerBI/Tableau)Open-source, Free DeploymentAnalytical Workflow<table align="center"><tr align="center"><th><p align="center">Operations Optimization</p></th><th><p align="center">Workforce Health</p></th><th><p align="center">AI Early Warning</p></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><p align="center"><i>[Chart: Ops Analytics]</i></p></td><td align="center"><p align="center"><i>[Chart: HR Analytics]</i></p></td><td align="center"><p align="center"><i>[Chart: ML Predictions]</i></p></td></tr><tr><td align="center">On-time Rate • Overtime • Turn-over</td><td align="center">Tenure • eNPS Score • Attrition Trend</td><td align="center">Flight Risk • Feature Importance</td></tr></table>Installation & SetupThe project is structured to run smoothly on any local environment with Python installed.1. Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/LQP-CTER/GHN-executive-dashboard.git](https://github.com/LQP-CTER/GHN-executive-dashboard.git)
cd GHN-executive-dashboard
2. Install dependencies(It is recommended to create a virtual environment venv before installation)pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the applicationstreamlit run app.py
The application will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:8501.Data ArchitectureThe system operates on four primary data sources located in the root directory:staff_info.csv: Employee demographic details, roles, and assigned warehouses.employee_logs.csv: Daily operational check-in/check-out logs.engagement_survey_raw.csv: Raw employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) survey data.attrition_data.csv: Historical records of resigned employees and corresponding reasons.AuthorDeveloped by Le Quy Phat - Data Analyst Candidate.This project was developed as a technical assessment to demonstrate the practical application of advanced data analytics and machine learning within a Logistics corporate environment.
